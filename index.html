            <p>I am the master of HTML, CSS and Javascript. I know everything needed to make a website function,
                efficient.
                I didn't stop with the web. I went beyond with most popular Javascript framework called Vue JS. I even
                know
                the deployment, server and security. I will give you 100% web solution.</p>

            <p>They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web developer. I made their website and showed
                it
                to them. They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.</p>
